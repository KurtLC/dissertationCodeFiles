# Data Breach #

*This folder contains the Home Assistant (HA) code files which were manipulated to leak the data/events generated by HA to two individual web servers.*

---------------
## Folder Contents ##

* **[[1]httpsServer](https://github.com/KurtL33/dissertationCodeFiles/tree/main/modified_hass_code_files/%5B2%5Ddata_breach/%5B1%5DhttpsServer) folder:** contains the HA code files that were modified to POST the generated events to the HTTPS Server.

* **[[2]webhook](https://github.com/KurtL33/dissertationCodeFiles/tree/main/modified_hass_code_files/%5B2%5Ddata_breach/%5B2%5Dwebhook) folder:** contains the HA code files that were modified to POST the generated events to the Webhook site.

* **[[3]httpsServer_and_webhook](https://github.com/KurtL33/dissertationCodeFiles/tree/main/modified_hass_code_files/%5B2%5Ddata_breach/%5B3%5DhttpsServer_and_webhook) folder:** contains an amalgamation of both [1] and [2] whereby the modified HA code is set to leak to both web servers.
<br />

***Note:** The webhook.site link specified in each Python file found in [2] and [3] would need to be updated so that the data is dumped to the simulated attacker's account (as opposed to the currently embedded link which has since been deleted).*
